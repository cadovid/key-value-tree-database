# Building a key-value store through a tree structure

In this project, a B-tree data structure is implemented from scratch as a building block for a fully functioning key-value store. This key-value store will work like a Python dictionary, but it will also allow users to perform range queries, similar to multiple implementations of the key-value store used in production-grade systems worldwide, like __Redis__, __CouchDB__, __Mongo__, or __Cassandra__. In this way, these queries are performed in a more efficient computation time than in a simpler implementation.
